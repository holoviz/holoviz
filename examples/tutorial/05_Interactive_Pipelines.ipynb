    "The plots built up over the first few tutorials were already highly interactive in the web browser, with interactive tools and events in each plot, and sometimes Bokeh widgets created by HoloViews automatically to select a specific categorical value from a `groupby`. However, when you are exploring a dataset, the automatic interactivity may not be enough -- you may want to add interactive control to some other aspect of how data is selected or generated or how it is visualized that _you_ decide. Luckily, HoloViz makes it almost trivially easy to add any interactive behavior that you want, making it easy for you or your users to explore any parameter or setting in your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Though we haven't yet needed to discuss it, the Bokeh widgets generated by hvPlot were configured using the [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org) library from HoloViz, which focuses on widgets, layouts, and constructing standalone HoloViz applications. In this notebook, we'll use Panel's support for the \"reactive expressions\" from the underlying [Param](https://param.holoviz.org/Reactive_Expressions) library to add just about any interactivity you can imagine. E.g. if you want to control  filtering or selecting or aggregation in your Pandas or GeoPandas or Dask DataFrame, or Xarray Dataset, you simply wrap that object in `pn.rx()`. `pn.rx()` returns an reactive object (e.g. a reactive Pandas DataFrame) that can be used almost exactly the same as the original object (e.g. calling regular Pandas methods) but whose *output* (e.g. a DataFrame view) will be re-computed everytime one of the reactive pipeline *inputs* change. The *inputs* are typically widgets (e.g. a drop-down list) that replace values you would usually hard-code and manually update to observe how they affect the output. When such an reactive object is displayed in a notebook, it includes the widgets that you have used together with the regular output, and the output is automatically updated appropriately."
