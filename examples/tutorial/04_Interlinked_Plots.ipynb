If you see a few outliers or a clump of unusual datapoints in your  _u_ vs. _v_ plot, how can you find out the properties of those points in the _w_ vs. _z_ or other plots?

HoloViews objects store metadata about what dimensions they cover, and we can use this metadata programmatically to let the user see how any data points in any plot relate across different plots."

By default, selections on both histograms are combined so that the selection is the intersection of the two regions selected (data points matching _both_ the constraints on depth and the constraints on magnitude that you select). For instance, try selecting the deepest earthquakes (around 600), and you can see that those are not specific to one particular magnitude. You can then further select a particular magnitude range, and see how that range is distributed in depth over the selected depth range. Linked selections like this make it feasible to look at specific regions of a multidimensional space and see how the properties of those regions compare to the properties of other regions. You can use the Bokeh reset tool (double arrow) to clear your selection.\n",

Linked selections let you see relationships between your data's dimensions and clusters of datapoints much more directly, so that you can:\n",

    "This approach is very general and allows a deeper understanding of high-dimensional data through interactivity. This interactivity is itself built on the very powerful HoloViews 'streams' system which you can leverage for yourself to build youw own [Custom Interactivity](./07_Custom_Interactivity.ipynb) (optional, advanced topic) when necessary.\n",
