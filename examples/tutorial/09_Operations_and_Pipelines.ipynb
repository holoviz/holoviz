    "When interactively exploring a dataset you often end up interleaving visualization and analysis code. In HoloViews your visualization and your data are one and the same, so analysis and data transformations can be applied directly to the visualizable data. For that purpose HoloViews provides operations, which can be used to implement any analysis or data transformation you might want to do. Operations take a HoloViews Element and return another Element of either the same type or a new type, depending on the operation. We'll illustrate operations and pipelines using a variety of libraries:\n",
