A better approach to caching will be presented in the [Advanced Dashboards](./08_Advanced_Dashboards.ipynb) section of the tutorial."

    "\n",
    "When exploring data it can be convenient to use the `.plot` API to quickly visualize a particular dataset. By calling `.hvplot` to generate different plots over the course of a session and then linking such plots together, it is possible to gradually build up a mental model of how a particular dataset is structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the workflow presented here, building such custom interaction is relatively quick and easy and does not involve throwing away prior code used to generate simpler plots. In the spirit of 'short cuts not dead ends', we can use the HoloViews-object output of `hvplot` that we used in our initial exploration to build rich visualizations with custom interaction to explore our data at a deeper level. \n",
    "\n",
    "These interactive visualizations not only allow for custom interactions beyond the scope of `hvplot` alone, but they can display visual annotations not offered by the `.plot` API. In particular, we can overlay our data on top of tile sources, generate interactive textual annotations, draw shapes such a circles, mark horizontal and vertical marker lines and much more. Using HoloViews you can build visualizations that allow you to directly interact with your data in a useful and intuitive manner."
