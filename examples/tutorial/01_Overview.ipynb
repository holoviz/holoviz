The main libraries in this ecosystem include:\n",

    "-   [HoloViews](http://holoviews.org): Declarative objects for instantly visualizable data, building Bokeh/Matplotlib/Plotly plots from convenient high-level specifications\n",
    "-   [GeoViews](http://geoviews.org): Visualizable geographic data that that can be mixed and matched with HoloViews objects\n",
    "-   [Datashader](http://datashader.org): Rasterizing huge datasets quickly as fixed-size arrays or images\n",
    "-   [Lumen](https://lumen.holoviz.org): Building Panel dashboards with HoloViews plots from a text file (low code) or GUI (no code)\n",
    "-   [Param](http://param.pyviz.org): Declaring user-relevant parameters, making it simple to work with widgets inside and outside of a notebook context\n",
