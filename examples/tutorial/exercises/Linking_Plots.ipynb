    "If you change `kind='points'` to `kind='scatter'` on one or both plots above, you should see what looks like precisely the same plots, so you may wonder why there are two different but so similar plots available. But if you then make a selection, you should be able to see the difference (try it both ways!). We used a points plot above, because the latitude and longitude do not have a dependent relationship with time, and a scatter plot requires and conveys such a relationship. Here if you make a box selection on a scatter plot, you'll see that the selected \"box\" is actually a region of the x axis, because the selection is applied only to the key dimensions (independent variables), not to any dependent variables. Whereas the same selection on a points plot will select on both latitude/longitude and time, resulting in a box-shaped selection rather than a horizontal span. Differences in behavior like this are why it is important to be explicit about what you are assuming about how your data dimensions are related. \n",
    "\n",
    "When in doubt, use a points plot unless you really do want to claim that (or investigate whether) `y` depends on `x`, as a scatter plot assumes. E.g. could you imagine swapping `x` and `y` and still have a meaningful plot? If not, it's a candidate for a scatter plot; otherwise it's a points plot."
