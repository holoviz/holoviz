    "So far we have generated plots using [hvPlot](http://hvplot.pyviz.org), but we haven't discussed what exactly these plots are and how they differ from the output of other libraries offering the `.plot` API. It turns out that as in the previous `pn.interact` example, the `.hvplot()` output is actually a rich, compositional object that can be used in many different ways, not just as an immediate plot.  Specifically, hvPlot generates [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org) objects rendered using the [bokeh](https://bokeh.org) backend. In the previous notebook we saw that these objects are rendered as interactive Bokeh plots that support hovering, panning, and zooming. \n",
