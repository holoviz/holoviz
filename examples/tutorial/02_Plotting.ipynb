    "If you have tried to visualize a `pandas.DataFrame` before, then you have likely encountered the [Pandas .plot() API](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html). These plotting commands use [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) to render static PNGs or SVGs in a Jupyter notebook using the `inline` backend, or interactive figures via `%matplotlib widget`, with a command that can be as simple as `df.plot()` for a DataFrame with one or two columns. \n",

    "The Pandas .plot() API has emerged as a de-facto standard for high-level plotting APIs in Python, and is now supported by many different libraries that use various underlying plotting engines to provide additional power and flexibility. Learning this API allows you to access capabilities provided by a wide variety of underlying tools, with relatively little additional effort. The libraries currently supporting this API include:\n",

    "- [Pandas Bokeh](https://github.com/PatrikHlobil/Pandas-Bokeh) -- Bokeh-based interactive plots, for Pandas, GeoPandas, and PySpark data.\n",
