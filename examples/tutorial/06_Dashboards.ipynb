    "\n",
    "## Sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are happy with the dashboard you have built, it's time to share it! You can find on [Panel's website](https://panel.holoviz.org/how_to/index.html#share-your-work) more details about how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- configure the server\n",
    "- deploy the application on various platforms (e.g. Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Hugging Face)\n",
    "- save a dashboard as a static HTML file\n",
    "- deploy a dashboard leveraging a new technology called WebAssembly thanks to which (and to Pyodide or PyScript) a Python application can run entirely in the browser, making it a lot easier to deploy a dashboard as you no longer need to bother setting up a server\n",
    "\n",
    "Though this feature is brand new as of 6/2023 and not yet documented on Panel's website, you can now easily deploy Panel dashboards on [Anaconda Notebooks](https://anaconda.cloud/anaconda-tools) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lumen\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel is a highly flexible library to build apps and dashboards that provides all the required building blocks for you to assemble as you like. The [Lumen library](https://lumen.holoviz.org/) is a relatively new addition to the HoloViz ecosystem that is much more opinionated about what a data app is, handling many of the tasks involved automatically. Building on top of [Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) Panel, Lumen can take care of ingesting, filtering, transforming and viewing data, all through a declarative specification that can be stored in YAML files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques above and in the previous notebooks should enable you to build complex, deeply interlinked layouts and dashboards that help you understand your data and uncover hidden relationships, with custom interactivity for exploring any parameters of interest. You can explore further at the websites for any of the tools mentioned here, starting at [hvplot.holoviz.org](https://hvplot.holoviz.org) and moving on from there as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the tutorials so far, we have focused almost exclusively on the highest-level APIs provided by HoloViz, namely `.hvplot()` and `.interactive()`. These interfaces let you focus on the data you are trying to work with, without getting bogged down in writing dozens or hundreds of lines of plotting or callback code. Of course, they don't cover every possible type of plot or interactivity, and if you want full control, you'll need to learn the lower-level APIs provided by HoloViz tools (HoloViews and Panel), or the even lower-level tools, like Bokeh. The remaining tutorials are entirely optional, but they introduce some of those lower-level APIs so that you can see how to do things more manually when needed. These later tutorials are particularly useful for understanding the examples of interesting apps at [examples.holoviz.org](https://examples.holoviz.org), most of which were written before the simple `.interactive()` interface was developed."
