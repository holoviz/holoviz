    "Panel allows you to build interactive apps and dashboards in the notebook and then deploy them as a separate server. One of the main aims behind Panel is to allow you to lay out and add interactive controls to many of objects you are used to working with in the PyData ecosystem. This ability to a) deploy dashboards straight from your notebook and b) display all the plots and objects you are used to working with allows it to plug easily into your existing workflows and build interactive components and dashboards you can share with colleagues or outside of your organization.\n",

    "In this section of the tutorial we will get you familiarized with the three main types of components, to get you started on displaying objects with Panel, laying them out and then connecting them to interactive widgets to build simple apps. Finally we will take you through an exercise to build a simple dashboard from a number of existing components.\n",
