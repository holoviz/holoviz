## What is HoloViz?

HoloViz provides high-level Python tools that are designed to work together to solve the entire problem of visualization, from conducting exploratory data analysis to deploying complex dashboards.

The core HoloViz projects are:

- [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org): Create interactive dashboards in Jupyter notebooks or standalone apps
- [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org): Quickly and interactively explore data with a familiar API
- [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org): Visualize and analyze using high-level and meaningful descriptions of data TODO: fix this **********
- [GeoViews](http://geoviews.org): Extend HoloViews for geographic data
- [Datashader](https://datashader.org): Render big data images in a browser
- [Lumen](https://lumen.holoviz.org/): Construct no-code dashboards from simple YAML specifications
- [Colorcet](https://colorcet.holoviz.org/): Plot with perceptually based colormaps
- [Param](https://param.holoviz.org): Declaratively code in Python

All HoloViz projects are freely available for commercial or
non-commercial use according to a permissive open-source license as
described in each project's website.
