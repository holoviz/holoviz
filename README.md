## What is HoloViz?

HoloViz provides high-level tools that are designed to work together to solve the entire problem of visualization, from conducting exploratory data analysis to deploying complex dashboards.

The core HoloViz projects are:

- [hvPlot](https://hvplot.holoviz.org): interactive plotting built on Bokeh, Matplotlib, and Plotly
- [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org): declarative high-level data description and plotting
- [GeoViews](http://geoviews.org): geographic data extension for HoloViews
- [Datashader](https://datashader.org): server-side rendering of large datasets
- [Colorcet](https://colorcet.holoviz.org/): perceptually based colormapping
- [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org): interactive apps and dashboards
- [Lumen](https://lumen.holoviz.org/): no-code apps and dashboards
- [Param](https://param.holoviz.org): declarative parameter-based coding

All HoloViz projects are freely available for commercial or
non-commercial use according to a permissive open-source license as
described in each project's website.
