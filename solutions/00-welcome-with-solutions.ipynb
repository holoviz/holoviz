    "HoloViews is an [open-source](https://github.com/ioam/holoviews) Python library that makes it simpler to explore your data and communicate the results to others.  Compared to other tools, the most important feature of HoloViews is that:\n",
    "\n",
    "**HoloViews lets you work seamlessly with both the data** ***and*** **its graphical representation.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When using HoloViews, the focus is on bundling your data together with the appropriate metadata to support both analysis and plotting, making your raw data *and* its visualization equally accessible at all times.  This tutorial will introduce HoloViews and guide you through the process of building rich, deployable visualizations based on [Bokeh](bokeh.pydata.org), [Datashader](https://github.com/bokeh/datashader), and (briefly) [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)."
