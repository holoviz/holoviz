    "Data scientists and analysts very often switch between interactively exploring some data themselves, and then creating apps and dashboards for sharing their analyses with others.  The Jupyter notebook environment supports a rich ecosystem of tools for exploratory, interactive visualizations, but these tools are often quite separate from those supporting app deployment. Bridging between these two common activities is thus needlessly difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will be introducing a set of open-source Python libraries we have been developing to streamline the process of working with small and large datasets (from a few points to billions), whether doing exploratory analysis, making simple widget-based tools, or building full-featured dashboards. The libraries in this ecosystem include:\n",
