# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Diversity Statement

We welcome and encourage participation in our community by people of all backgrounds
and identities. We are committed to promoting and sustaining a culture that values
mutual respect, tolerance, and learning, and we work together as a community to
help each other live out these values.

We have created this diversity statement because we believe that a diverse community
is stronger, more vibrant, and produces better software and better science. A diverse
community where people treat each other with respect has more potential contributors,
more sources for ideas, and fewer shared assumptions that might hinder development
or research.

Although we have phrased the formal diversity statement generically to make it all-inclusive,
we recognize that there are specific identities that are impacted by systemic discrimination
and marginalization. We welcome all people to participate in the HoloViz Organization
and community regardless of their identity or background.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is representing the community in public spaces.

Our community consists of contributors in their efforts related to the development
and distribution of any materials for the HoloViz organization. The projects in this
community include the repositories in the [HoloViz GitHub organization](https://github.com/holoviz),
such as Colorcet, Datashader, GeoViews, HoloViews, hvPlot, Lumen, Panel, and Param.
Other efforts, whether online or in-person, undertaken by this community and coordinated
through [HoloViz communication channels](https://holoviz.org/community.html) are
also covered under this Code of Conduct. This code applies equally to founders,
developers, mentors and new community members, in all spaces managed by HoloViz.
In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a personâ€™s ability
to participate within them.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the HoloViz Code of Conduct committee at
[coc@holoviz.org](mailto:coc@holoviz.org), or by filling out
[this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfeb8zVV8ugTPJ33YFSm18K_eTSQRubb4Dn_iRYeu8uniCmSQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)
which can be submitted anonymously and gets forwarded to coc@holoviz.org. Currently, the committee consists of:

* Sophia Yang [@sophiamyang](https://github.com/sophiamyang/)
* Marc Skov Madsen [@MarcSkovMadsen](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen)
* Philipp Rudiger [@philippjfr](https://github.com/philippjfr)

If your complaint involves anyone who is on this list, please reach out separately
to one or more members of the list who have not been involved in the behavior in
question. If a report involves a member of the listed committee, that member will
not participate in the investigation or any decisions related to that report.

If you choose to email instead of using the form, please include the following information:

* Your contact info (if you would like us to be able to follow up or collect additional
information)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were
other witnesses besides you, try to include them as well
* When and where the incident occurred (please be as specific as possible)
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a
mailing list archive or GitHub/Gitter) please include a link
* Any extra context you believe is relevant for the incident
* If you believe this incident is ongoing
* Any other information you believe we should have

*Note*: with anonymous reports, there are inherent limits in our ability to do follow-up
or collect additional information. If you are uncomfortable sharing your identity,
consider creating a throw-away email address without your real name so that we will
be able to reach you.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All Code of
Conduct committee members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident. Further details of committee membership policies may be
posted separately.
