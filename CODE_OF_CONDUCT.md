# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall
  community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of
  any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address,
  without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is representing the community in public spaces.

Our community consists of contributors in their efforts related to the development and distribution of any materials for the HoloViz organization. The projects in this community include the repositories in the [HoloViz GitHub organization](https://github.com/holoviz), such as Colorcet, Datashader, GeoViews, HoloViews, hvPlot, Lumen, Panel, and Param. Other efforts, whether online or in-person, undertaken by this community and coordinated through [HoloViz communication channels](https://holoviz.org/community.html) are also covered under this Code of Conduct. This code applies equally to founders, developers, mentors and new community members, in all spaces managed by HoloViz. In addition, violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person’s ability to participate within them.

## Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the HoloViz Code of Conduct committee at
[holoviz.conduct@gmail.com](mailto:holoviz.conduct@gmail.com), or by filling out [TODO: this form]() which can be submitted anonymously. Currently, the committee consists of:
* James Bednar [@jbednar](https://github.com/jbednar)
* Marc Skov Madsen [@MarcSkovMadsen](https://github.com/MarcSkovMadsen)
* Philipp Rudiger [@philippjfr](https://github.com/philippjfr)

If your complaint involves anyone who is on this list, please reach out separately to one or more members of the list who have not been involved in the behavior in question. If a report involves a member of the listed committee, that member will not participate in the investigation or any decisions related to that report.

If you choose to email instead of using the form, please include the following information:

* Your contact info (if you would like us to be able to follow up or collect additional information)
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, try to include them as well
* When and where the incident occurred (please be as specific as possible)
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or GitHub/gitter.im) please include a link
* Any extra context you believe is relevant for the incident
* If you believe this incident is ongoing
* Any other information you believe we should have

*Note*: with anonymous reports, there are inherent limits in our ability to do follow-up or collect additional information. If you are uncomfortable sharing your identity, consider creating a throw-away email address without your real name so that we will be able to reach you.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All Code of Conduct committee members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Further details of committee membership policies may be posted separately. 

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.
