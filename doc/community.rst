*********************
The HoloViz community
*********************

Some development efforts for HoloViz tools are done with corporate or
government funding, but most of the documentation and community
engagement is done on a volunteer basis. As the community of HoloViz
users and developers continues to grow, we are trying to find
sustainable ways of welcoming new members, holding conversations, 
answering questions, and addressing issues. This page gives 
guidelines on the most effective methods for each type of interaction.

**Have a question about how to use HoloViz tools?** After the docs, your
first stop should be StackOverflow for 
`HoloViz <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/holoviz>`__ or for
older issues `PyViz <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pyviz>`__,
or our `Discourse site. <https://discourse.holoviz.org>`_
Search for an existing answer to your question, or post a new one (and
make sure you include the "**holoviz**" tag if you are on StackOverflow).
StackOverflow and Discourse are for *usage* questions:

- How do I do X with holoviz tools? (Preferably showing how close you've gotten so far, with code)
- For my own code, why am I seeing X rather than what I wanted?

**Have you found an issue with a HoloViz tool?** If you think something
is missing or not behaving as expected, visit the Github issue tracker
for the relevant project. HoloViz projects are hosted under the HoloViz
`GitHub organization <https://github.com/holoviz>`__.  GitHub is where
bugs and enhancements are logged and discussed.  Search for relevant
existing issues to comment on, or submit your own (following these
`guidelines <http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports>`__
if at all possible). Use the GitHub issue tracker for:

- **Bug reports** (like "The text gets cut off in a Panel object.")
- **Documentation issues** (like "I found this section unclear")
- **Feature requests** (like "I think that Colorcet should have a jet colormap")

**Do you have a quick, specific issue that likely has an immediate solution?**
You can chat with other users on the PyViz `Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/pyviz/pyviz>`__.
You can use gitter for very quick feedback while you are working on a task:

- Does anyone know if there is support for X somewhere in holoviz?
- I'm having trouble setting up the development environment.
- I messed up my git branches, can someone take a look?
- Does anyone know how to make this behavior change?

But note that most people who go to Gitter should really go to
Discourse instead, taking the time to make a proper post with all the
details. Usually on gitter our response will just be "please open a
Discourse issue". Gitter is well suited for chatting and live
discussion, but because it is not archived and not easily searchable,
we discourage using it for anything else.

**Want to become a contributor?** We hold recurring developer meetings 
and welcome anyone interested in becoming a contributor.

- General HoloViz meeting: This occurs biweekly on Fridays and is the best option for new members to join.
- Issue Triaging meeting: This occurs weekly on Mondays. It starts with some quick coordination and then splits off to triage project issues.
- Docs meeting: This occurs biweekly on Wednesdays and is focused on anything related to the documentation. 

Meeting notes are available on `hackmd.io/@holoviz/minutes <https://hackmd.io/@holoviz/minutes>`__

**Have you gotten your question answered?** If you use any of these
mechanisms to interact with HoloViz developers and find that we answered
your question, or even if you just looked for a long time and finally
discovered a solution, there is one important thing you can do to help
out the community: Please consider making a pull request to the docs, examples,
or FAQ for that project with that information, so that a future user
won't get stuck in the same way.

And please tweet at us (@holoviews, @datashader, @Panel_org, @holoviz_org) often to
show off what you are making with HoloViz tools and help spread the
word!
