*********************
The HoloViz community
*********************

The HoloViz developers pledge to act in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.
Please read more about this pledge in our `code of conduct <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviz/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>`__.

Some of the development on HoloViz projects is funded, but a lot is done on a volunteer basis - especially documentation and community engagement.
As the HoloViz community of users and contributors grows, we try to find sustainable ways of welcoming new members, holding conversations, answering questions, and addressing issues.
This page provides guidelines for different types of community interaction.

**Usage questions and discussions** happen in the `HoloViz Discourse forum <https://discourse.holoviz.org>`__. This forum is also a good place to showcase your HoloViz work and ask for feedback. 
Usage questions may also be directed to StackOverflow (using the `#HoloViz <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/holoviz>`__ tag).

**Bug reports, feature requests, and documentation issues** go in the appropriate project's GitHub issue tracker. HoloViz projects are hosted under the HoloViz
`GitHub organization <https://github.com/holoviz>`__. For issues relating to this HoloViz.org website, use the `HoloViz/HoloViz <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviz/issues>`__ GitHub issue tracker.
Please follow these
`guidelines for minimal bug reports <http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports>`__, when possible. 

**Social media tagging** is highly encouraged and appreciated when promoting HoloViz and your work. Please use the #HoloViz tag, as well as the relevant HoloViz project tags (e.g. #Panel or #hvPlot).
Additionally, you can follow us on Twitter at the following accounts: @HoloViz_org, @HoloViews, @Datashader, and @Panel_org.

**Real-time chat** for *contributors* occurs on our `Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/pyviz/pyviz>`__. This platform is good for quick and simple questions or comments, but Gitter is not archived or easily searchable so the `HoloViz Discourse forum <https://discourse.holoviz.org>`__ is a better place for discussions.

**Developer meetings** are shown in the calendar widget below.

- General HoloViz meeting: This occurs biweekly on Fridays and is the best option for new members to join.
- Issue Triaging meeting: This occurs weekly on Mondays. It starts with some quick coordination and then splits off to triage project issues, so please join on time.
- Docs meeting: This occurs biweekly on Wednesdays and is focused on anything related to the documentation. 

Meeting notes are available on `hackmd.io/@holoviz/minutes <https://hackmd.io/@holoviz/minutes>`__

And please tweet at us (@HoloViews, @Datashader, @Panel_org, @HoloViz_org) often to
show off what you are making with HoloViz tools and help spread the
word!
