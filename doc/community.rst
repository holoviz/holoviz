*******************
The PyViz community
*******************

As the community of PyViz users and developers grows - we are trying to find a sustainable
way of holding conversations and answering questions. If you interact with our developers, 
whether on gitter or on github or StackOverflow, and find that they answered a question you 
had, please consider making a PR to the docs, examples or FAQ with that information so 
that a future user won't get stuck in the same way. This is a guideline of which channels
are preferred for different types of interactions.

Have a question about PyViz? Your first stop should be `Stack Overflow
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pyviz>`__. Search for an existing answer to
your question, or post a new one (and make sure you include the "**pyviz**"
tag). Use StackOverflow for *usage* questions: 
  
  - How do I do X with pyviz tools?
  - Why am I seeing text rather than a plot?

If you think something is missing or note behaving as expected, visit the issue tracker 
for the relevant project. All projects are under the PyViz `GitHub organization <https://github.com/pyviz>`__.
GitHub is where bugs and enhancements are logged and discussed. 
Search for relevant existing issues to comment on, or submit your own. Use the GitHub issue 
tracker for:

  - **Bug reports** (like “The text gets cut off in panel object.”)
  - **Documentation issues** (like “I found this section unclear”)
  - **Feature requests** (like “I think that colorcet should have a jet colormap.”)

You can also chat with other users on the PyViz `Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/pyviz/pyviz>`__.
Use gitter for quick feedback on development issues:

  - I’m having trouble setting up the development environment.
  - I messed up my git branches, can someone take a look?
  
Tweet at us (@holoviews, @datashader, @pyviz_org) to show off what you are making with pyviz tools.
