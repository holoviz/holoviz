*******************
The PyViz community
*******************

Some development efforts for PyViz tools are done with corporate or
government funding, but most of the documentation and community
engagement is done on a volunteer basis. As the community of PyViz
users and developers continues to grow, we are trying to find
sustainable ways of holding conversations, answering questions, and
addressing issues. This page gives guidelines on the most effective
methods for each type of interaction.

**Have a question about how to use PyViz tools?** After the docs, your
first stop should be
`Stack Overflow <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pyviz>`__. 
Search for an existing answer to your question, or post a new one (and
make sure you include the "**pyviz**" tag). StackOverflow is for
*usage* questions:
  
  - How do I do X with pyviz tools?
  - Why am I seeing text rather than a plot?

**Have you found an issue with a PyViz tool?** If you think something
is missing or not behaving as expected, visit the Github issue tracker
for the relevant project. All projects are under the PyViz 
`GitHub organization <https://github.com/pyviz>`__.  GitHub is where
bugs and enhancements are logged and discussed.  Search for relevant
existing issues to comment on, or submit your own (following these
`guidelines <http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports>`__
if at all possible). Use the GitHub issue tracker for:

  - **Bug reports** (like "The text gets cut off in a panel object.")
  - **Documentation issues** (like "I found this section unclear")
  - **Feature requests** (like "I think that colorcet should have a jet colormap")
  
**Do you have a quick, specific issue that likely has an immediate solution?**
You can chat with other users on the PyViz `Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/pyviz/pyviz>`__.
Use gitter for quick feedback while you are working on a task:

  - I'm having trouble setting up the development environment.
  - I messed up my git branches, can someone take a look?
  - Does anyone know how to make this behavior change?

**Have you gotten your question answered?** If you use any of these
mechanisms to interact with PyViz developers and find that we answered
your question, or even if you just looked for a long time and finally
discovered a solution, there is one important thing you can do to help
out the community: Please consider making a PR to the docs, examples,
or FAQ for that project with that information, so that a future user
won't get stuck in the same way.
    
And please tweet at us (@holoviews, @datashader, @bokehplots, #pyviz) often to
show off what you are making with PyViz tools and help spread the
word!
