This is the organizational charter for the HoloViz Organization. The HoloViz Organization is an open-source and collaborative effort with a mission to develop solutions for a wide range of visualization problems in Python.

## 1. Terminology

- "HoloViz" or "HoloViz Community" or "Community": The entire HoloViz ecosystem of Users, Contributors, Projects, and communication channels
- "HoloViz Organization" or "Organization": The voting members of HoloViz Committees and Projects
- "HoloViz GitHub Organization": The Github organization at <https://github.com/holoviz>
- "HoloViz Projects" or "Projects" or "Organization Projects": Repositories in the HoloViz GitHub Organization and their voting members
- "HoloViz repo" or "HoloViz repository": The specific repository at <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviz>
- "HoloViz.org": The website at <https://holoviz.org/>

## 2. Organization Steering Committee

By adding their name to the [Steering Committee.md file](./STEERING-COMMITTEE.md), Steering Committee members agree to the policies in this document.

**2.1 Purpose**. The Steering Committee will be responsible for:

- Admitting or removing Projects from the Organization
- Appointing or removing members from the Steering Committee
- Setting the overall scope, vision, policy, and direction of the Organization
- Handling strategic collaborations with other organizations or individuals
- Making financial decisions and setting funding strategies
- Managing trademarks and other legal matters for the Organization
- Making technical decisions whose implementation or impact spans across HoloViz Projects

The Steering Committee is *not* responsible for software and other technical decisions that relate to individual projects.

**2.2 Composition**. The Steering Committee voting members are listed in the steering-committee.md file in the repository. Voting members may be added or removed by no less than 3/4 affirmative vote of the Steering Committee. There may be no less than 3 active members of the Steering Committee. If the membership count decreases to 2, all Steering Committee activity is halted, except for the election of a new member. If there are either 0 or 1 Steering Committee members, all Steering Committee activity is halted until the HoloViz Project Leads elect at least 3 total Steering Committee members in a special election that follows the 3/4 affirmative vote policy.

## 3. Voting

**3.1. Decision Making**. The Steering Committee will strive for all decisions to be made by consensus. While explicit agreement of the entire Steering Committee is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Steering Committee will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the Steering Committee and nature of support and objections. The Steering Committee will publicly and consistently document evidence of consensus, consensus date, and issue description. For example, these records may be recorded in meeting minutes or the comments on a GitHub Issue or Pull Request. If consensus cannot be reached, the Steering Committee will make the decision by a vote.

**3.2. Voting**. Any member of the Steering Committee may call a vote with reasonable notice to the Steering Committee, setting out a reasonable deadline by which to cast a vote (at least 3 days). Any discussion may be conducted in person or electronically by text, voice, or video. The vote must take place in such a way that all Committee members are aware that there is a vote and understand how to cast a vote. Individual vote counts should be recorded in a consistent and publicly accessible format that includes the date, proposer, description, and amount (in the case of financial matters). In any vote, each voting representative will have one vote. Except as specifically noted elsewhere in this charter, decisions by vote require a simple majority vote of all reachable and vote-participating members.

For example, a Committee member decides to call for a vote on a financial issue that did not previously reach consensus. This member files an issue on the HoloViz repository that clearly details the context, states precisely what an affirmative ("+1") or negative ("-1") vote means in regards to the issue being voted on, individually tags each other member of the Committee to ensure that they are notified, and has a title starting with "VOTE:". This proposing member also specifies a date by which a votes will be tallied - 1 week beyond the posting date. In this example, 7 Committee members vote by the deadline, of which 5 vote affirmative, and therefore the issue is considered carried and the issue is closed.

**3.3 Quorum**. Unless otherwise stated, a quorum for a vote can be met with at least 50% of active members, and at minimum, 2 participants. For example, in a vote requiring a simple majority, with 10 active members, at least 5 must vote; if 5 vote, there must be 3 affirmative votes. If there are 3 active members, at least 2 must vote; if 2 vote there must be 2 affirmative votes.

## 4. Termination of Membership

In addition to the method set out in section 2.2, the membership of a Steering Committee member will terminate if any of the following occur:

**4.1 Resignation**. Written notice of resignation to the Steering Committee.

**4.2 Unreachable Member**. If a member is unresponsive at its listed handle for more than three months the Steering Committee may vote to remove the member. The vote will be by simple majority of the reachable and vote-participating committee members.

## 5. Trademarks

Any names, trademarks, service marks, logos, mascots, or similar indicators of source or origin and the goodwill associated with them arising out of the Organization's activities or Organization projects' activities (the "Marks"), are controlled by the Organization. Steering Committee members may only use the Marks in accordance with the Organization's [trademark policy](./TRADEMARKS.md). If a Steering Committee member is terminated or removed from the Steering Committee, any rights the Steering Committee member may have in the Marks revert to the Organization.

## 6. Antitrust Policy

The Steering Committee is bound by the Organization's [antitrust policy](./ANTITRUST.md).

## 7. No Confidentiality

Information disclosed in connection with any of the Organization's activities, including but not limited to meetings, Contributions, and submissions, is not confidential, regardless of any markings or statements to the contrary.

## 8. Project Criteria

In order to be eligible to be an Organization project, a project must:

- Be approved by the Steering Committee.
- Agree to follow the guidance and direction of the Steering Committee.
- Use only the following outbound licenses or agreements unless otherwise approved:
  - For code, a license on the Open Source Initiative's list of [Popular Licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses).
  - For data, a license on the Open Knowledge Foundation's list of [Recommended Conformant Licenses](http://opendefinition.org/licenses/).
  - For specifications, a community developed and maintained specification agreement, such the [Open Web Foundation Agreements](https://www.openwebfoundation.org/the-agreements) or [Community Specification Agreement](https://github.com/CommunitySpecification/1.0).
- Include and adhere to the Organization's policies, including the [trademark policy](./TRADEMARKS.md), the [antitrust policy](./ANTITRUST.md), and the [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## 9. Amendments

Amendments to this charter, the [antitrust policy](./ANTITRUST.md), the [trademark policy](./TRADEMARKS.md), or the [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) may only be made with at least a 3/4 affirmative vote of the Steering Committee.

## 10. Code of Conduct Committee

The Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC) will be responsible for enforcing and updating the [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

The current CoCC members are listed in the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) file in the repository. Unless removed, CoCC members may serve for life, as long as they adhere to the Organization's policies, including the [trademark policy](./TRADEMARKS.md), the [antitrust policy](./ANTITRUST.md), and the [code of conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). Voting members may be added or removed by a simple majority of the their fellow reachable and vote-participating CoCC members. CoCC members are expected to recuse themselves if they have a conflict of interest, and are required to recuse themselves if they are the accused or the target of the reported behavior. CoCC members may also resign at any time. There must be at least three individuals serving on the CoCC at any time, but there is no upper limit on the number of CoCC members. If a member is unresponsive at their listed handle for more than three months the CoCC may vote to remove the member.

The CoCC will strive for all decisions to be made by consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, the CoCC will make the decision by a vote. In order to take action, a simple majority of eligible CoCC members must vote (eligible members do not include those excluded because of conflicts of interest) and a simple majority of the votes cast need to be affirmative.

## 11. Infrastructure and Account Access

Upon request, all infrastructure access and associated accounts that are common to multiple HoloViz Projects must be made accessible to any member of the Steering Committee. However, one committee member may be delegated to monitor and maintain individual aspects or accounts.
