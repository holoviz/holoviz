# Governance Documents

The HoloViz governance has **two** levels - the **HoloViz Organization**
and the **individual HoloViz Projects**. This split allows us to stay aligned
as a community while supporting and benefiting from a diverse set of initiatives.

The governing bodies at the HoloViz Organization level are the Steering Committee
and Code of Conduct Committee. The Steering Committee is responsible for
higher-level aspects of the Organization, such as setting the overall scope, vision,
policy, and direction.

Each HoloViz Project may specify their own governance that is compatible with the HoloViz
Organization governance. As an example of governance at the HoloViz Project level,
let's consider this HoloViz.org website Project. The governing body of this Project
is the Maintainers, one of which is the Project Director, and another may be the
Lead Maintainer. The Project Director is responsible for the overall direction and
scope of the Project while a Lead Maintainer is responsible for releases and
day-to-day technical management of the Project. Find the governance for other HoloViz Projects in the appropriate
repository within the [HoloViz GitHub Organization](https://github.com/holoviz).
