About Us
========

HoloViz is a collaboration between the maintainers of several Python packages,
including
`HoloViews <http://holoviews.org>`_,
`GeoViews <http://geoviews.org>`_,
`hvPlot <https://hvplot.pyviz.org>`_,
`Datashader <http://datashader.org>`_,
`Param <https://param.pyviz.org>`_, 
`Colorcet <https://colorcet.pyviz.org>`_, and
`Panel <https://panel.pyviz.org>`_.

The authors of these tools are working together closely to help make
them into a coherent solution to a wide range of Python visualization
problems.

If you like HoloViz, please `tweet <http://twitter.com>`_ a screenshot
of your latest creation at ``@HoloViz_org``, linking to ``holoviz.org``
along with any other library you relied on (``@HoloViews``,
``@Datashader``, ``@Panel_org``, ``@Bokeh``, ``@Matplotlib``, etc.). Thanks!

There is an active open source community around HoloViz, and
contributions from anyone are welcome. Contributions of any sort are
valuable, including new documentation, plus bug reports and fixes to
code or documentation that might seem trivial (HoloViz is partly about
having as many of those ironed out as possible!). Please go ahead and
open a `pull request <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_
or create a `new issue <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviz/issues/new>`_
:)

While the HoloViz team itself maintains a number of packages on `HoloViz's
GitHub <https://github.com/holoviz>`_, HoloViz depends on and supports a
number of other open-source libraries; for more information, see
HoloViz's `detailed background <background.html>`_.

The entire HoloViz stack is open source, free for commercial and
non-commercial use. However, if you are lucky enough to be in a
position to fund developers to work on HoloViz, you can contact
``sales@anaconda.com``, or you can also collaborate with HoloViz via
`Quansight's open source partnerships <https://www.quansight.com/projects>`_.

Acknowledgements and prior funding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HoloViz libraries have been supported by a variety of different funding mechanisms since 2003:

- Human Brain Project grant 1R01-MH66991 to the University of Texas Department of Computer Sciences
  from the U.S. National Institutes of Mental Health, supporting the initial development of the Param library.

- Grants EP/F500385/1 and BB/F529254/1 to the `University of Edinburgh
  Doctoral Training Centre in Neuroinformatics and Computational
  Neuroscience <http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc>`_ from the UK Engineering
  and Physical Sciences Research Council, Biotechnology and Biological
  Sciences Research Council, and Medical Research Council, supporting the initial
  development of the HoloViews library.

- Contracts to Continuum Analytics, Inc. supporting the initial development of
  GeoViews (from the UK Met Office),  Datashader and Colorcet (from In-Q-Tel), and
  Panel (from the US Army Corps of Engineers ERDC).
