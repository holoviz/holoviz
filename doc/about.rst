About Us
========

HoloViz is a collaboration between the maintainers of several Python packages,
including
`HoloViews <http://holoviews.org>`_,
`GeoViews <http://geoviews.org>`_,
`hvPlot <https://hvplot.pyviz.org>`_,
`Datashader <http://datashader.org>`_,
`Param <https://param.pyviz.org>`_, 
`Colorcet <https://colorcet.pyviz.org>`_, and
`Panel <https://panel.pyviz.org>`_.

The authors of these tools are working together closely to help make
them into a coherent solution to a wide range of Python visualization
problems.

If you like HoloViz, please `tweet <http://twitter.com>`_ a screenshot
of your latest creation at ``@HoloViz_org``, linking to ``holoviz.org``
along with any other library you relied on (``@HoloViews``,
``@Datashader``, ``@Panel_org``, ``@Bokeh``, ``@Matplotlib``, etc.). Thanks!

There is an active open source community around HoloViz, and
contributions from anyone are welcome. Contributions of any sort are
valuable, including new documentation, plus bug reports and fixes to
code or documentation that might seem trivial (HoloViz is partly about
having as many of those ironed out as possible!). Please go ahead and
open a `pull request <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_
or create a `new issue <https://github.com/holoviz/holoviz/issues/new>`_
:)

While the HoloViz team itself maintains a number of packages on `HoloViz's
GitHub <https://github.com/holoviz>`_, HoloViz depends on and supports a
number of other open-source libraries; for more information, see
HoloViz's `detailed background <background.html>`_.

The entire HoloViz stack is open source, free for commercial and
non-commercial use. However, if you are lucky enough to be in a
position to fund developers to work on HoloViz, you can contact
``sales@anaconda.com``, or you can also collaborate with HoloViz via
`Quansight's open source partnerships <https://www.quansight.com/projects>`_.

Acknowledgements and prior funding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

HoloViz libraries have been supported by a variety of different funding mechanisms since 2003:

- Human Brain Project grant 1R01-MH66991 to the University of Texas Department of Computer Sciences
  from the U.S. National Institutes of Mental Health, supporting the initial development of the Param library.

- Grants EP/F500385/1 and BB/F529254/1 to the `University of Edinburgh
  Doctoral Training Centre in Neuroinformatics and Computational
  Neuroscience <http://www.anc.ed.ac.uk/dtc>`_ from the UK Engineering
  and Physical Sciences Research Council, Biotechnology and Biological
  Sciences Research Council, and Medical Research Council, supporting the initial
  development of the HoloViews library.

- Contracts to Anaconda, Inc. supporting the initial development of
  GeoViews (from the UK Met Office),  Datashader and Colorcet (from DARPA
  and In-Q-Tel), and Panel (from the US Army Corps of Engineers ERDC).

- Contracts to Anaconda, Inc. from Blackstone, Inc. supporting Panel, and from
  many other government agencies and corporations contributing to the maintenance
  and development of all the HoloViz libraries.

Governance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The HoloViz governance has two levels - the HoloViz Organization 
and the individual HoloViz Projects. This split allows us to stay aligned 
as a community while supporting and benefiting from a diverse set of initiatives.

The governing bodies at the HoloViz Organzation level are the Steering Committee 
and Code of Conduct Committee. The Steering Committee is responsible for 
higher-level aspects of the Organization, such as setting the overall scope, vision, 
policy, and direction. Read more about Organization governance 
`here<https://github.com/holoviz/holoviz/tree/master/doc/governance/org-docs/CHARTER.md>`_.

Each HoloViz Project may specify their own governance that is compatible with the HoloViz
Organization governance. As an example of governance at the HoloViz Project level, 
let's consider this HoloViz.org website Project. The governing body of this Project 
is the Maintainers, one of which is the Project Director, and another may be the 
Lead Maintainer. The Project Director is responsible for the overall direction and 
scope of the Project while a Lead Maintainer is responsible for releases and 
day-to-day technical management of the Project. Read more about this website's 
Project's Governance
`here<https://github.com/holoviz/holoviz/tree/master/doc/governance/project-docs/GOVERNANCE.md>`_, 
or find the governance for other HoloViz Projects in the appropriate 
repository within the `HoloViz GitHub Organization <https://github.com/holoviz>`_.
