About Us
========

PyViz is a collaboration between the maintainers of several packages,
including
`Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org>`_,
`HoloViews <http://holoviews.org>`_,
`GeoViews <http://geo.holoviews.org>`_,
`hvPlot <https://hvplot.pyviz.org>`_,
`Datashader <http://datashader.org>`_,
`Param <https://param.pyviz.org>`_, and
`Panel <https://panel.pyviz.org>`_.

The authors of these tools are working together closely to help make
them into a coherent solution to a wide range of Python visualization
problems.

If you like PyViz, please `tweet <http://twitter.com>`_ a screenshot
of your latest creation at ``@PyViz_org``, linking to ``pyviz.org``
along with any other library you relied on (``@HoloViews``,
``@Datashader``, ``@BokehPlots``, ``@Matplotlib``, etc.). Thanks!

There is an active open source community around PyViz, and
contributions from anyone are welcome. Contributions of any sort are
valuable, including new documentation, plus bug reports and fixes to
code or documentation that might seem trivial (PyViz is partly about
having as many of those ironed out as possible!). Please go ahead and
open a `pull request <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>`_
or create a `new issue <https://github.com/pyviz/pyviz/issues/new>`_
:)

While the PyViz team itself maintains a number of packages on `PyViz's
GitHub <https://github.com/pyviz>`_, PyViz depends on and supports a
number of other open-source libraries; for more information, see
PyViz's `detailed background <http://pyviz.org/background.html>`_.

The entire PyViz stack is open source, free for commercial and
non-commercial use. However, if you are lucky enough to be in a
position to fund developers to work on PyViz, you can contact
``sales@anaconda.com``, or you can also collaborate with PyViz via
`Quansight's open source partnerships
<https://www.quansight.com/projects>`_.

Additionally, some parts of the PyViz stack are able to accept
donations, e.g. `Bokeh via NumFOCUS
<https://numfocus.org/project/bokeh>`_.
