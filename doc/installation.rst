Installation
============

If you want to use a HoloViz tool, you can install it into your
current environment with pip or conda just as you would any other
Python library. To get the most common HoloViz tools (panel,
hvplot, holoviews, datashader, param, and colorcet), just do:

   > conda install hvplot datashader

You can add ``geoviews`` to that list if you have geographic data that needs
to be projected into different coordinates, and you can add ``lumen`` if you
want to try low-code and no-code ways to use HoloViz tools.

Tutorial Installation
=====================

If you want to run the tutorials, we recommend following the five
steps below instead of (or in addition to) installing HoloViz tools
into your main environment. These tutorial installation instructions
create a fully independent, separate environment just for running the
tutorials, including all core and optional dependencies pinned to
known working versions. That way, you can be sure you're using the
versions that have been tested with these examples, and you can also
delete the entire directory later with no trace if you decide the
tools aren't useful to you.


Step 1: Install a `Miniconda <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_  (or `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/downloads>`_) environment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows computer with a web browser (preferably
Google Chrome) should be suitable. 16GB of RAM is required for some of
the examples, but most will run fine in 4GB.

If you don't already have conda on your machine, you can get it from
`conda.io <https://conda.io/miniconda.html>`_, and then open a terminal
window with the conda environment activated.

If you do have conda already, it's a good idea to update it (running it
twice to get the very latest) to ensure you have the latest version::

   > conda update -n base conda
   > conda update -n base conda

You should then make sure you have `anaconda-project` installed:

::

   > conda install anaconda-project


Step 2: Download and extract the tutorial project
-------------------------------------------------

The following steps will fetch and extract the latest version of the
HoloViz tutorial. The tutorial files and associated conda environment
will be installed in the current directory, and should not affect
any other Python environments you may have.

*If you are attending a live tutorial or workshop, make sure to run
these steps again the day before the tutorial to ensure you have the
same version of the project that the presenter will use.*

::

   > anaconda-project download pyviz/holoviz_tutorial

If you have already run this command in the current directory, you may
need to remove the existing `holoviz_tutorial` directory before the
command above will execute. Once the download is completed, change to
the tutorial directory with:

::

     > cd holoviz_tutorial


Step 3: Launch Jupyter Notebook
-------------------------------

You can then launch the Jupyter notebook server and client::

   > anaconda-project run jupyter notebook

(replacing "notebook" with "lab" if you prefer Jupyter Lab to the classic
single-pane Jupyter interface).

A browser tab with a Jupyter instance should now open,
letting you navigate through subdirectories and select a notebook to work on.
In this case, go into the ``tutorial`` subdirectory and load ``index.ipynb``, 
which will let you launch each of the tutorials and exercises.

If you don't see Jupyter appear as a new browser tab automatically, you 
may need to cut and paste the URL from the console output manually.

Step 4: Download data files and test that everything is working
---------------------------------------------------------------

You can see if everything has installed correctly by selecting the
``Setup`` notebook from the index and doing "Cell/Run All" in the
menus. There may be warnings on some platforms, but you'll know it is
working if you see the orange HoloViews logo after it runs
``hv.extension()``.

Running this notebook will also download the data files needed by the
tutorial.


Step 5: Run the tutorials
-------------------------

Now you can run through the `tutorials <tutorial/index.rst>`_, learn
how to use all these tools, and apply them to anything you need to
visualize.  Have fun!
