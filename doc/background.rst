Background: Why PyViz?
======================

Many of the activities of a data scientist or analyst require
visualization, but it can be difficult to assemble a set of tools that
cover all of the tasks involved. Initial exploration needs to be in a
flexible, open-ended environment where it is simple to try out and test
hypotheses. Once key aspects of the data have been identified, the
analyst might prepare a specific image or figure to share with
colleagues or a wider audience. Or, they might need to set up an
interactive way to share a set of data that would be unwieldy as a fixed
figure, using interactive controls to let others explore the effects of
certain variables. Eventually, for particularly important data or use
cases, the analyst might get involved in a long-term project to develop
a full-featured web application or dashboard to deploy, allowing
decision makers to interact directly with live data streams to make
operational decisions.

With Python, initial exploration is typically in a
`Jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`__ notebook, using tools like Matplotlib
and Bokeh to develop static or interactive plots. These tools support a
simple syntax for making certain kinds of plots, but showing more
complex relationships in data can quickly turn into a major software
development exercise, making it difficult to achieve understanding
during exploration. Simple apps can be built using ipywidgets to control
these visualizations, but the resulting combinations end up being
tightly coupled to the notebook environment, unable to migrate into a
standalone server context with an application that can be shared more
widely. Bokeh includes widgets that can work in both notebook and server
environments, but these can be difficult to work with for initial
exploration. Bokeh and Matplotlib both also have limitations on how much
data they can handle, in part because Bokeh requires the data to be put
into the web browser's limited memory space.

To address these issues, we have developed a set of open-source Python
packages to streamline the process of working with small and large datasets
(from a few points to billions) in a web browser, whether doing
exploratory analysis, making simple widget-based tools, or building
full-featured dashboards. The libraries in this ecosystem include:

-  `Bokeh <http://bokeh.pydata.org>`__: Interactive plotting in web
   browsers, running JavaScript but controlled by Python
-  `HoloViews <http://holoviews.org>`__: Declarative objects for
   instantly visualizable data, building Bokeh plots from convenient
   high-level specifications
-  `GeoViews <http://geo.holoviews.org>`__: Visualizable geographic
   data that that can be mixed and matched with HoloViews objects
-  `hvPlot <http://hvplot.pyviz.org>`__: Quickly return interactive
   HoloViews or GeoViews objects from your Pandas, Xarray, or other
   data structures
-  `Datashader <https://github.com/bokeh/datashader>`__: Rasterizing
   huge datasets quickly as fixed-size images
-  `Param <https://github.com/ioam/param>`__: Declaring
   user-relevant parameters, making it simple to work with widgets
   inside and outside of a notebook context

These projects can be used separately or together in a wide variety of
different configurations to address different needs. For instance, if we
focus on the needs of a data scientist/analyst who wants to understand
the properties of their data, we can compare that to the approach
suggested for a software developer wanting to build a highly custom
software application for data of different sizes:

Here Datashader is used to make large datasets practical by rendering
images outside the browser, either directly for a programmer or via a
convenient high-level interface using HoloViews (or hvPlot), and the
results can be embedded in interactive Bokeh plots if desired, either
as a static HTML plot, in a Jupyter notebook, or as a standaline
application.

Behind the scenes, these tools rely on a wide range of other open-source
libraries for their implementation, including:

-  `Pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org>`__: Convenient computation on
   columnar datasets (used by HoloViews and datashader)
-  `Xarray <http://xarray>`__: Convenient computations on
   multidimensional array datasets (used by HoloViews and Datashader)
-  `Dask <http://dask.pydata.org>`__: Efficient
   out-of-core/distributed computation on massive datasets (used by
   Datashader)
-  `Numba <http://numba.pydata.org>`__: Accelerated machine code for
   inner loops (used by Datashader)
-  `Fastparquet <https://fastparquet.readthedocs.io>`__: Efficient
   storage for columnar data
-  `Cartopy <http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy>`__: Support for
   geographical data (using a wide range of other libraries)

The PyViz tutorials will guide you through the process of using these tools
together to build rich, high-performance, scalable, flexible, and
deployable visualizations, apps, and dashboards, without having to use
JavaScript or other web technologies explicitly, and without having to
rewrite your code to move between each of the different tasks or phases
from exploration to deployment. In each case, we'll try to draw your
attention to libraries and approaches that help you get the job done,
which in turn depend on many other unseen libraries in the scientific
Python ecosystem to do the heavy lifting.

Getting started
---------------

First, you should browse through the already-run versions of the PyViz
`tutorials <tutorial/index.html>`__ to see what they cover and how it all
works. But everything on this website is a Jupyter Notebook that you can
run yourself, once you follow the  `installation <installation>`__
instructions, so the next step is to try it all out and have fun exploring
it!
