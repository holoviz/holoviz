     <p>
      PyViz helps coordinate between numerous independent open-source
projects, each with their own developers, priorities, and agendas. In
large part, the future of PyViz is up to a distributed team of
developers that focus on the areas of greatest current interest and
need, including areas that specifically get current funding.
     </p>
     <p>
      Immediate, already funded priorities for 2018 include:
     </p>
     <ol class="arabic simple">
      <li>
       <strong>
        Ongoing maintenance, improved documentation and examples
       </strong>
       : As
always, there are various bugs and usability issues reported on the
issue tracker, and we will address these as time permits.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Better dashboard/app support
       </strong>
       : Making it simpler to make powerful
dashboards starting from code that works well in a Jupyter notebook,
including as a simple report, a notebook-backed arbitrary screen
layout, and sharing components between notebooks and complex deployed
apps.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Better widget support
       </strong>
       :
       <ul>
        <li>
         Extensions and generalizations to the ParamBokeh library to make it
simpler to add interactive widgets and control their layout and
appearance.
        </li>
        <li>
         Support for expressing dependencies between Parameters that will be
respected at the widget level, allowing more complex apps to be built
with minimal coding.
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Improved imaging, simulation, machine learning, and Earth science
workflows
       </strong>
       : Support for working with image and other
multidimensional data for visualization and machine-learning
applications, including on HPC systems.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Improvements to Bokeh/HoloViews drawing tools
       </strong>
       :
       <ul>
        <li>
         Better support for collecting annotations
        </li>
        <li>
         undo
        </li>
        <li>
         other usability improvements
        </li>
       </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Simpler deployment of large-scale visualizations
       </strong>
       : Automatic
generation of slippy-map tiles for exploration of large datasets
using standard web servers
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Better Datashader integration with external plotting libraries
(Bokeh, HoloViews, Matplotlib)
       </strong>
       : Datashader needs to provide
functions for supporting hover information, legends, colorbars, and
interactivity, which each plotting library can then use.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        HoloViews serialization
       </strong>
       : HoloViews uses a declarative design that
can be represented in a purely textual form, without any Python code.
An initial implementation allows any Param-based objects (including
HoloViews objects) to be represented in JSON or YAML, but it needs
some polishing before it can be put into wide use for saving and
restoring configurations and layouts.
      </li>
      <li>
       <strong>
        Support for maintaining Python-based projects
       </strong>
       : As maintainers of
a wide range of Python projects, we are working to minimize the cost
of maintaining each one, by sharing code for tracking versions,
making releases, providing example scripts, managing datasets,
documenting examples, testing examples (including notebooks), and
building websites. Projects addressing each of these areas are being
added to the
       <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/pyviz">
        PyViz Github organization
       </a>
       and will be documented in the main PyViz site as they become mature.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Other things we’d like to see in PyViz or in packages designed to work
well with PyViz include:
     </p>
     <ol class="arabic">
      <li>
       <p class="first">
        <strong>
         Bokeh WebGL support
        </strong>
        : Bokeh provides good support for working
interactively with small datasets using an HTML Canvas (client-side
interactivity), and when combined with Datashader it can handle
enormous datasets by pre-rendering them to images in Python
(server-side). However, in between these two extremes there is a
range of data sizes that could be addressed well by the client-side
WebGL technology. Bokeh includes some WebGL support, but it is patchy
and not fully implemented, so it is not the default for either direct
Bokeh usage or for Bokeh with the HoloViews API. Volunteers to
maintain and expand the WebGL support could make a much broader range
of data sizes practical in easily redistributable standalone HTML
files, and could enable new classes of high-performance interactive
features.
       </p>
      </li>
      <li>
       <p class="first">
        <strong>
         Integrating 3D surface and volume rendering into PyViz
        </strong>
        : HoloViews
can plot limited quantities of 3D surface or point data using
        <a class="reference external" href="http://holoviews.org/reference/elements/matplotlib/TriSurface.html">
         Matplotlib
        </a>
        or
        <a class="reference external" href="http://holoviews.org/reference/elements/plotly/TriSurface.html">
         Plotly
        </a>
        ,
but other tools are needed for larger datasets or for volumetric
rendering with transparent/semitransparent voxels. Improving 3D
support could be as simple as providing examples for using existing
tools like
        <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipyvolume">
         IPyVolume
        </a>
        and
        <a class="reference external" href="http://vaex.astro.rug.nl">
         Vaex
        </a>
        , or by wrapping JavaScript
libraries like
        <a class="reference external" href="https://threejs.org">
         ThreeJS
        </a>
        and
        <a class="reference external" href="https://cesiumjs.org">
         CesiumJS
        </a>
        .  There’s a first
        <a class="reference external" href="http://assets.holoviews.org/demos/HoloViews_CesiumJS.html">
         prototype
for a CesiumJS backend now available
        </a>
        ,
but lots more work to do to make it practical for real use.

        <strong>
         Toolbox for GIS primitives
        </strong>
        : The PyViz stack is fully general
purpose, supporting data of any type, and already has many advantages
over traditional Earth-specific approaches to dealing with data with
latitude and longitude coordinates. However, existing GIS packages
make certain domain-specific functionality simpler, such as computing
vegetation indexes and other common manipulations of Earth-related
data. It would be helpful to provide a well-tested collection of
these common operations built on the PyViz stack so that it can be a
more “drop-in” replacement for proprietary GIS systems.  Examples
of desirable functionality:

         Better native GUI support
        </strong>
        : Right now, PyViz focuses exclusively
on tools that work well in web browsers, because it aims to support
the entire workflow from initial exploration to delivery of fully
functional interactive applications to other stakeholders. One
consequence is that it doesn’t currently support the types of
interactivity provided by Matplotlib when used with its native GUI
backends like Qt. It should be feasible to make the interactive
functionality in HoloViews (e.g. streams and DynamicMaps) support
native GUI apps as well, allowing the same user code to be applied to
a wider range of use cases.

         Altair/Vega/Vega-lite integration
        </strong>
        : HoloViews and Bokeh provide
declarative syntaxes that can be expressed in purely static form, and
it should be feasible to write a translator between them and other
declarative libraries like Altair, Vega, and Vega-Lite. Those
libraries are currently focused primarily on statistical
visualizations, not covering areas like multidimensional (image-like)
plotting where HoloViews and Bokeh are also used, but they offer a
common interchange format that could be helpful for interoperating
with other tools. Writing an import and export facility that covers
the bulk of the shared functionality should not be a major
undertaking and could open up interesting new applications.

in PyViz are ready for Python users to put together into
visualizations and apps, but they would also make a very strong
base for building a graphical approach for working with data, with
drag and drop layouts, GUI-configurable mapping of data sources, and
GUI configuration of the plot objects. HoloViews components are
already declarative, which means that they can be mapped directly
into GUI elements for changing their parameters dynamically. Paired
with the new

         Intake
        </a>
        library for declaring data sources, it would be possible to build a
fully graphical interface for working with data that would have the
advantage of being backed by a fully configurable, open-source set
of plotting library elements, ensuring that when people outgrow
the GUI framework they can easily extend and expand anything
developed in it, unlike current business intelligence and
dashboarding applications.
