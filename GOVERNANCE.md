See [HoloViz.org > Governance](https://holoviz.org/about/governance/index.html) for full description.

Summary:

1. The [Organization Governance](https://github.com/holoviz/holoviz/blob/main/doc/about/governance/org-docs/CHARTER.md) covers all HoloViz related efforts.
2. Each HoloViz Project further adopts and hosts their own Project Governance (e.g. [Datashader Project Governance](https://github.com/holoviz/holoviz/blob/main/doc/about/governance/project-docs/GOVERNANCE.md)) in accordance with the HoloViz Organization Governance.
